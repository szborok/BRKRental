    "about_us_title": "About Us",
    "about_us_intro": "At our motorcycle rental company, we believe in keeping the spirit of riding alive, no matter how busy life gets. Our journey started with a simple observation: as my friends and the people around me got older and life became more serious with responsibilities like having children, they found less and less time to ride their bikes. What used to be a passion became a once-a-year event, with their motorcycles often sitting idle, collecting dust. They rode just 200 km in the year before they eventually decided to sell their beloved bikes.",
    "about_us_story": "Seeing this, I realized there was a way to give these motorcycles a new lease on life while keeping the connection alive for their original owners. I decided to buy these bikes from my friends and rent them out. This way, not only could these beautiful machines continue to be enjoyed by new riders, but whenever their original owners wanted to feel the thrill of the open road again, they could do so on \"their\" bike.",
    "about_us_mission": "Our mission is to provide an opportunity for everyone to experience the joy of riding a motorcycle, whether they are seasoned riders or new enthusiasts. We offer a range of motorcycles, many with a sentimental history, allowing riders to create their own memories while respecting the bike's past.",
